[Kaj-Kolja Kleineberg and Dirk Helbing. "Collective navigation of complex networks: Participatory greedy routing"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-02910-x) Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 2897 (2017) doi:10.1038/s41598-017-02910-x

*Kleineberg and Helbing create and agent based model where agents represents nodes in an internet of things architecture. Node incurs a cost when passing a message, but profit from the message being successfully delivered. Only nodes which take part in passing the message are rewarded, hence the model being an example of participatory greedy routing. Nodes start as either cooperators or defectors and update their strategy after each message is sent. The author find a bistable system which has either high performance or breaks down completely. They then go on to analyze factors which cause the system to be more likely to end in a state of high performance.*
