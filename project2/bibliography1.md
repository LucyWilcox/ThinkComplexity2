*Zapotecatl et al. create a set of rules for an cellular automata based system for optimizing traffic lights. Extending their model, the authors allow the traffic lights to communicate with the upstream and downstream traffic lights. Next, the authors determine a set of performance measures with which they analyze their model. They run experiments for the models they develop and the green wave model (which gives vehicles a series of green lights and is commonly used) for different and vehicles densities. They find that their proposed models are more efficient than the green wave model as determined by flow and velocity.*
