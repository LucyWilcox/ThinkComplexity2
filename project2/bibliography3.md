A Spatial Agent-Based Model for the Simulation of Adults’ Daily Walking Within a City.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3306662/) American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 40(3), 353–361. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2010.11.017

Yang et al. create an agent based model of walking behaviors of agents in cities. Each agent has a variety of activities it performs and different walking attributes. The agents attitudes towards walking can also change over time. The model is used to simulate how agents react to environmental conditions like safety and aims to explain differences in walking behavior based on socioeconomic status. They find that feedback mechanisms lead to different purposes for walking being more prevalent in different groups.
