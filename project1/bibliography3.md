*Ruhl, Katz, and Bommarito explore Supreme Court cases and citations. They find that there is a shift of reliance on foreign to domestic laws causing more citations between domestic cases following the war of 1812. They believe that the current interconnected structure of the legal system could lead to risks and regulatory system failures. To measure this, they create a complex adaptive system (CAS) of the legal system. In creating this network model they hope to identify these interconnected structures which could cause, in their words: cascading failure. Their model can be used to analyze legal systems and they believe that complexity science may be used to help people understand and design these systems in the future.*
