[Dash Nelson G, Rae A. An Economic Geography of the United States: From Commutes to Megaregions.](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pone.0166083

*Nelson and Rae argue that the United States is best represented as megaregions and not states. They use commutes as a proxy for economic interconnection to analyze the existence of these megaregions. They find that these megaregions are statistically-significant and can be represented by people'sâ€™ commuting patterns. They compare these results with a visual heuristic as well.*
